# lock-guard.sh -- fail if a repo's COMMITTED/STAGED Cargo.lock drifted from shipping-form.
#
# THE RULE (notes/design/release-robustness-spec.md; decision (A) in notes/02-DECISIONS.md). A
# committed Cargo.lock must record the SHIPPING form of every theia sibling: each sibling
# resolved from its `github.com/theia-hq/<repo>` git source at the exact rev its Cargo.toml
# pins, and every in-repo crate's lock version matching its own manifest. Four drifts break
# that, and this gate FAILS on any of them:
#
#   (a) PATH-DRIFT   -- a sibling's lock block has NO git `source =` line, a `path+` one, or any
#       source that is not the exact `git+https://github.com/theia-hq/<repo>?rev=<40hex>#<40hex>`
#       form. A local patched `cargo build` (the umbrella .cargo/config.toml [patch]es siblings to
#       local paths) rewrites the lock to path sources by design; committing that leaks the dev
#       machine's layout into the shipping lock. THIS IS THE EXACT v0.7.0 SAGA the gate stops.
#   (b) REV DISAGREEMENT -- a sibling's lock rev != the rev its Cargo.toml git dep pins. Catches
#       a manifest rev bump that never regenerated the lock, statically (no build needed).
#   (c) OWN-VERSION SKEW -- an in-repo crate's lock `version` != its manifest `[package] version`.
#       The `cargo bump the version, forget to sync the lock` footgun, made mechanical.
#   (d) PATCH ARTIFACT -- the committed lock carries a `[[patch.unused]]` block. A shipping lock
#       is resolved patch-free and never carries patch artifacts; their presence means it was
#       written under the umbrella root [patch] (F12, red mains 2026-09-08..11), not a clean
#       resolve.
#
# WHY IT READS THE COMMITTED/STAGED LOCK, NOT THE WORKING-TREE FILE. Under the containment model
# a patched local build ALWAYS re-dirties the working-tree Cargo.lock to path sources (and an
# in-flight release may have bumped a manifest version that the committed lock hasn't caught up
# to yet). That ambient working-tree drift is EXPECTED local state, never a failure. The gate's
# job is only to stop that dirt from being COMMITTED, so it reads what a commit would record:
# the git INDEX (`git show :PATH`), which equals HEAD for an unstaged file and the staged blob
# for a `git add`ed one. Both the lock AND the manifests are read from the index so the check is
# coherent (a working-tree-only version bump does not trip check (c) against the committed lock).
# Outside a git repo it falls back to the on-disk files, so it still works on a plain checkout.
#
# NOTHING IS HARDCODED about WHICH siblings exist: the sibling set is DERIVED from the git deps
# in the manifests (same derive-from-manifest spirit as scripts/layering-gate.sh). Co-located
# path members (beam/fetch/measure/sshh) are NOT siblings and are never required to carry a git
# source, which is what distinguishes a legit sourceless workspace member from a path-drifted
# sibling.
#
# Dependency-free: POSIX sh + git + grep/sed/awk. Run from a repo root (or pass a root path):
#   sh scripts/lock-guard.sh [ROOT]
